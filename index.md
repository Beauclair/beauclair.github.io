Projects:

Chase merchant services Bulk processing: application to process large file containing different type of transaction (Capture, Refund...) which is uploaded by the merchant and moved to S3. Merchant can check the status of the job any time and also can request the list of the job that have been processed.

Walmart Scan&Go Audit services: centralized platform that provide services to evaluate each transaction, based on customer history, customer behavior, store trust level, and trigger an event if necessary so that associate can audited customer basket/cart. Audit service is actually used by Handheld and Mobile Scan&Go
Technologies: OneOps Cloud, JEE, Restful API, maven, Jenkins, Jira, Git, Couchbase, CI/CD, XML, JSON

Walmart Scan&Go: Solution that enables customers to scan the items as they shop and place them in the cart. When they are ready to pay, they would go to Self-checkout lane and scan the QR code on the attract screen. Register would be sent information to process their cart/basket and payment would be tendered as a normal store operating procedure. This helps customers to save time which is spent for scanning the items before they checkout.
Technologies: Java, Multithreading, Active MQ, AngularJS, Cordova, Restful web services, Microsoft Power BI 

Sample Serverless application: The goals here was to develop a single page hosted on S3 and served with low
